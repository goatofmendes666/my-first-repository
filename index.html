	<h1>Why is Paris called the city of lights?</h1>
	<p>Two reasons. First, it was among the first European cities to use gas street lamps back in the 1860s, making it literally a City of Light (see pic below). But also because earlier, in the 18th century, Paris was a essentially a hub during the Age of Enlightenment. So literally light, with enlightened minds. Voila. <br> <br> During the time of the ancient Greeks, there was much tension between the Trojans and the Greeks, leading to the famous Trojan War. It all started when Paris, the prince of the magnificent city of Troy, abducted a woman after making a deal with the goddess of love, Aphrodite. There are many variations on how the war began and the battles that took place during it, but one event stayed for certain: The story of the large, wooden horse that lead to the downfall of Troy. Most of the information about this historical event was recorded in Homer’s famous works, The Iliad and The Odyssey. The Trojan War was started by a petty feud between three goddesses, fought by brave warriors, and recorded in Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. Conflicts began between the Trojans and the Greeks began long ago when King Peleus, who later on became the father of the Trojan War hero, Achilles, married Thetis, a sea nymph.</p>
